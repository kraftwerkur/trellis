# Trellis — Enterprise AI Agent Orchestration

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Architecture defined. Pre-implementation.
**Owner:** Eric O'Brien, SVP Enterprise Technology
**One-liner:** Kubernetes for AI agents — manage, route, and govern hundreds of agents across a healthcare system, regardless of framework.

---

## Executive Summary (BLUF)

Health First needs a platform that manages AI agents the way Kubernetes manages containers: deploy them, route work to them, track their costs, and audit every action — without caring what framework they run on. Today we have one agent (SAM, HR) built on Pi SDK. Tomorrow we'll have dozens across HR, Revenue Cycle, IT, Clinical, and Supply Chain. This architecture defines a three-layer system — adapters that normalize any input into a generic envelope, a platform core that routes and governs, and agents that do the actual work. The platform is Azure-native, HIPAA-ready, and designed so that a Pi SDK agent, an OpenAI Assistants agent, and a vendor black-box can all coexist under the same governance model. We chose a hybrid approach (Shape C) that gives managed agents free FinOps and model routing while letting external agents bring their own inference. The result: one dashboard, one audit trail, one cost model for every AI agent in the enterprise.

### Layer 1: Adapters (Edges)

Dumb translators. Each adapter knows one protocol and converts it into a generic envelope. No business logic, no routing decisions, no state. An adapter's entire job: receive input → build envelope → POST to event router.

Adapters are infrastructure. The platform team owns all of them.

Supported input types:
- **Teams chat** — human messages via Bot Framework webhook
- **HTTP/webhook** — system-to-agent calls, manual triggers
- **HL7/FHIR** — Epic events via Azure Health Data Services
- **File/SFTP** — blob drops, flat file triggers
- **Message queue** — Azure Service Bus, Kafka consumers
- **Database/CDC** — change data capture, new row triggers
- **Schedule/cron** — time-based triggers via Azure Functions timer
- **Log stream** — Sentinel, LogicMonitor alerts
- **Form submission** — ServiceNow/Ivanti ticket creation
- **Voice** — 8x8 call transcription → text
- **Email** — mailbox monitoring via Graph API
- **Document** — PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, Markdown uploads → chunked text envelopes
- **Agent-to-agent** — internal delegation (just another envelope)

### Layer 2: Platform Core

The brain. Receives envelopes, decides where they go, enforces governance, tracks costs, logs everything. Detailed in [Platform Core Components](#platform-core-components).

### Layer 3: Agents (Workers)

Do the actual work. Framework-agnostic. Agents keep full autonomy — they own the logic loop, tool chaining, memory, and decision-making. They run on any framework (Pi SDK, LangChain, OpenAI Assistants, raw Python).

The key architectural constraint: **agents use Trellis as their LLM provider.** Instead of calling `api.openai.com` directly, agents point at the Trellis LLM Gateway (`trellis-llm.hf.internal/v1/chat/completions`). Same OpenAI-compatible API shape — agents don't even know they're going through Trellis. They just use a different base URL.

This gives the platform full cost visibility, model routing, and rate limiting without stripping agents of their autonomy. Agents still decide what to ask, when to chain tools, how to reason. Trellis decides which model answers, tracks every token, and enforces budgets.

External/vendor agents that can't point at the gateway are the exception — they self-report costs with anomaly monitoring and budget caps.

## Generic Envelope Spec

Every input, regardless of source, becomes this:

```json
{
  "envelope_id": "uuid",
  "source_type": "teams|api|file|queue|schedule|hl7|log|form|voice|agent|manual",
  "source_id": "identifier for the specific source instance",
  "payload": {
    "text": "optional — human message or parsed content",
    "data": {},
    "attachments": []
  },
  "metadata": {
    "trace_id": "uuid — links entire event chain",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "priority": "low|normal|high|critical",
    "sender": {
      "id": "azure-ad-oid or system identifier",
      "name": "display name",
      "department": "HR|IT|RevCycle|...",
      "roles": ["manager", "clinician", "admin"]
    }
  },
  "routing_hints": {
    "agent_id": "optional — direct routing bypass",
    "department": "optional — route to department's default agent",
    "category": "optional — semantic category for rules engine",
    "tags": []
  }
}
```

**Field notes:**
- `trace_id` is the single most important field. When Agent A delegates to Agent B, both envelopes share a `trace_id`. This is how we get end-to-end cost traces and audit chains.
- `source_type` + `source_id` together identify exactly which adapter instance produced the envelope. Useful for debugging and rate limiting.
- `routing_hints` are suggestions, not commands. The rules engine can override them. `agent_id` bypasses the rules engine only if the caller has direct-route permission.
- `payload.data` is unstructured. An HL7 adapter puts parsed FHIR resources here. A Teams adapter puts conversation context. The agent knows what to expect based on `source_type`.

---

## Platform Core Components

### Event Router

Receives envelopes from adapters via HTTP POST. Applies the rules engine to determine the target agent(s). Dispatches the envelope to the selected agent's registered endpoint. Handles fan-out (one event → multiple agents) and dead-letter (no matching rule → quarantine queue).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    E[Envelope IN] --> RE[Rules Engine]
    RE --> AL[Agent Lookup]
    AL --> D[Dispatch]
    D --> AU[Audit Log]
    AL -->|no match| DL[Dead Letter Queue]
```

The router is stateless. It doesn't queue — it dispatches synchronously or fires-and-forgets to the agent's endpoint. If we need guaranteed delivery, Azure Service Bus sits between the router and the agent.

### Rules Engine

Pre-dispatch governance. Rules are data, stored in the database, editable via dashboard. A rule is:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "uuid",
  "name": "Epic ADT events to bed management agent",
  "priority": 100,
  "conditions": {
    "source_type": "hl7",
    "payload.data.event_type": "ADT^A01",
    "metadata.priority": { "$in": ["high", "critical"] }
  },
  "actions": {
    "route_to": "agent-bed-mgmt",
    "set_priority": "critical",
    "require_approval": false
  },
  "active": true
}
```

Rules evaluate top-down by priority. First match wins (unless fan-out is configured). Conditions use a simple JSON query syntax — no code, no DSL to learn. Complex routing logic means you need more rules, not a smarter engine.

### Agent Registry

Every agent in the enterprise is registered here. Registration is the gate — no registration, no traffic.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "sam-hr",
  "name": "SAM — HR Operations Agent",
  "owner": "Jane Smith",
  "department": "HR",
  "framework": "pi-sdk",
  "endpoint": "https://sam-hr.azurecontainerapps.io/envelope",
  "health_endpoint": "https://sam-hr.azurecontainerapps.io/health",
  "tools": ["peoplesoft-lookup", "ukg-schedule", "email-send"],
  "channels": ["teams", "api"],
  "maturity": "assisted",
  "cost_mode": "managed",
  "created": "2026-02-22T00:00:00Z",
  "last_health_check": "2026-02-22T21:00:00Z",
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

**Maturity levels:** `shadow` → `assisted` → `autonomous`. Shadow agents execute but a human reviews before the result is delivered. Assisted agents deliver results but flag uncertainty for human review. Autonomous agents operate independently. The platform enforces these — not the agent.

### Tool Registry

Tools exist independently of agents. A tool is a capability: "look up an employee in PeopleSoft," "send an email," "query Epic FHIR endpoint." Tools have schemas (input/output), endpoints, and permission policies.

```json
{
  "tool_id": "peoplesoft-lookup",
  "name": "PeopleSoft Employee Lookup",
  "description": "Query HCM for employee records by ID or name",
  "schema": { "input": { "employee_id": "string" }, "output": { "record": "object" } },
  "endpoint": "https://tools.hf.internal/peoplesoft/lookup",
  "phi": true,
  "allowed_agents": ["sam-hr", "hr-onboarding"],
  "rate_limit": "100/hour"
}
```

Agents don't discover tools — they're assigned tools via policy. The CISO office reviews any tool marked `phi: true` before it goes live.

### LLM Gateway

**The critical infrastructure component.** The gateway is an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`) that agents use instead of calling LLM providers directly. Agents point their SDK's `base_url` at the gateway — no code changes needed, any framework that speaks OpenAI API works.

**Why this matters:** This is how Trellis gets full visibility without stripping agents of autonomy. The agent still owns its logic — what to ask, when to chain tools, how to reason. The gateway controls *which model answers* and *tracks every token*.

The gateway provides:

- **Model routing** — route to the cheapest model that can handle the task complexity (see FinOps). Agent can request a model, or let Trellis pick.
- **Cost tracking** — every token counted, attributed to agent + trace. Automatic. No self-reporting needed.
- **Rate limiting** — per-agent, per-department quotas and budget caps.
- **Hot-swap** — change the backing model for any agent without touching the agent. SAM runs on GPT-4o today, Ollama tomorrow — one config change.
- **Fallback chains** — primary model fails → try secondary → try local Ollama.
- **Agent authentication** — agents call the gateway with a Trellis-issued API key. Gateway knows which agent is calling, applies that agent's model policy and budget.
- **Tool call passthrough** — the gateway proxies tool/function calls transparently. LLM returns a tool call → gateway passes it back to the agent. Agent executes the tool using its own identity. Gateway logs the full conversation (prompt → tool call → tool result → response) for audit without intercepting execution.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SA[SAM Agent] -->|OpenAI-compatible call| GW[Trellis LLM Gateway<br/>trellis-llm/v1/chat/completions]
    IT[IT Help Agent] -->|same API shape| GW
    RC[Rev Cycle Agent] -->|same API shape| GW
    GW --> AUTH[Agent Auth + Budget Check]
    AUTH --> MR[Model Router]
    MR --> AO[Azure OpenAI]
    MR --> OL[Ollama]
    MR --> AN[Anthropic]
    GW --> FE[FinOps Engine<br/>Auto Token Tracking]
```

External/vendor agents that cannot point at the gateway self-report costs. They get budget caps and anomaly monitoring but not the full visibility of managed agents. This is the exception path, not the default.

### FinOps Engine

Every inference call, every tool invocation, every agent execution has a cost. The FinOps engine tracks it all.

Cost dimensions:
- **Per agent** — "SAM cost $47 this month"
- **Per query** — "This HR lookup cost $0.003"
- **Per department** — "HR agents cost $200/month total"
- **Per trace** — "This one Epic event triggered 3 agents and cost $0.15 end-to-end"

Data model:

```json
{
  "cost_event_id": "uuid",
  "trace_id": "links to envelope trace",
  "agent_id": "sam-hr",
  "department": "HR",
  "event_type": "llm_inference|tool_call|agent_execution",
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "tokens_in": 1200,
  "tokens_out": 350,
  "cost_usd": 0.002,
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
}
```

### Audit

Every action logged. Non-negotiable in healthcare. The audit log captures:

- Every envelope received (who sent what, when)
- Every routing decision (which rule matched, why)
- Every tool call (which agent called which tool, with what input)
- Every LLM inference (model, tokens, prompt — with PHI redaction)
- Every cost event
- Every agent registration change
- Every rule change

Audit logs are append-only, immutable, retained per HIPAA requirements (minimum 6 years). Stored in Azure Table Storage or Cosmos DB for cost efficiency at scale. Queryable via the dashboard.

---

## Agent Contract

To register on the platform, an agent must implement four endpoints:

### 1. `POST /envelope` — Handle Work

Accepts a generic envelope. Returns a result.

```json
// Request: Generic Envelope (see spec above)

// Response:
{
  "status": "completed|failed|delegated|pending_review",
  "result": {
    "text": "Human-readable response",
    "data": {},
    "attachments": []
  },
  "delegations": [
    { "target_agent": "agent-id", "envelope": { "..." } }
  ],
  "cost_report": {
    "inference_calls": 3,
    "total_tokens": 4500,
    "estimated_cost_usd": 0.008,
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
  }
}
```

### 2. `GET /health` — Health Check

Returns `200 OK` with `{ "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy" }`. Platform polls this every 60 seconds.

### 3. `POST /cost-report` — Cost Reporting (external agents only)

External agents that cannot use the Trellis LLM Gateway must POST cost data here on each execution. Managed agents skip this — the gateway tracks costs automatically because all inference flows through it.

### 4. `GET /manifest` — Agent Metadata

Returns the agent's registration data: name, tools needed, channels supported, maturity level. Used during initial registration and periodic sync.

That's it. Four endpoints. If you can serve HTTP, you can be an agent on this platform.

---

## Adapter Pattern

An adapter is a small, stateless service that converts a protocol-specific input into a generic envelope and POSTs it to the event router.

### Adapter Template

```typescript
interface Adapter {
  // Parse protocol-specific input into an envelope
  parse(raw: unknown): Envelope;

  // POST envelope to event router
  async forward(envelope: Envelope): Promise<void>;
}
```

Every adapter follows the same pattern:
1. Receive input in native protocol
2. Extract sender, content, metadata
3. Build envelope with appropriate `source_type`
4. Generate `envelope_id`, inherit or create `trace_id`
5. POST to `https://platform.hf.internal/router/envelope`

### Example: Teams Adapter

```typescript
// Receives Bot Framework Activity via webhook
app.post('/api/teams/messages', async (req, res) => {
  const activity: Activity = req.body;

  const envelope: Envelope = {
    envelope_id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    source_type: 'teams',
    source_id: `teams-${activity.channelId}-${activity.conversation.id}`,
    payload: {
      text: activity.text,
      data: {
        conversation_id: activity.conversation.id,
        message_id: activity.id,
        channel: activity.channelId
      },
      attachments: activity.attachments?.map(a => ({
        name: a.name,
        content_type: a.contentType,
        url: a.contentUrl
      })) ?? []
    },
    metadata: {
      trace_id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      priority: 'normal',
      sender: {
        id: activity.from.aadObjectId,
        name: activity.from.name,
        department: '', // resolved by platform via Azure AD lookup
        roles: []
      }
    },
    routing_hints: {
      tags: ['teams-chat']
    }
  };

  await forwardToRouter(envelope);
  res.status(202).send();
});
```

### Example: HL7/FHIR Adapter (The Killer Demo)

This is where the platform becomes undeniable. Epic fires an ADT event — patient admitted, transferred, discharged. Before a nurse finishes their documentation, the platform has already routed it to the right agent.

```typescript
// Receives FHIR Subscription notification from Azure Health Data Services
// Epic → Azure FHIR Server → FHIR Subscription → This adapter
app.post('/api/fhir/notify', async (req, res) => {
  const bundle: fhir.Bundle = req.body;

  for (const entry of bundle.entry) {
    const resource = entry.resource;

    const envelope: Envelope = {
      envelope_id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      source_type: 'hl7',
      source_id: `epic-fhir-${resource.resourceType}`,
      payload: {
        text: `${resource.resourceType} event: ${extractEventSummary(resource)}`,
        data: {
          resource_type: resource.resourceType,
          resource_id: resource.id,
          event_type: extractEventType(resource), // ADT^A01, ORM^O01, etc.
          fhir_resource: resource
        },
        attachments: []
      },
      metadata: {
        trace_id: crypto.randomUUID(),
        timestamp: resource.meta?.lastUpdated ?? new Date().toISOString(),
        priority: classifyPriority(resource), // ADT = high, lab result = normal
        sender: {
          id: 'epic-system',
          name: 'Epic EMR',
          department: extractDepartment(resource),
          roles: ['system']
        }
      },
      routing_hints: {
        category: resource.resourceType,
        tags: ['clinical', 'epic', resource.resourceType.toLowerCase()]
      }
    };

    await forwardToRouter(envelope);
  }

  res.status(200).send();
});
```

**The demo:** Epic fires an ADT^A01 (patient admission). FHIR subscription hits the adapter. Adapter builds an envelope. Rules engine matches "ADT events → bed management agent." Agent checks bed availability, flags conflicts, notifies charge nurse — all before the admitting clerk closes their Epic screen. Show that end-to-end in a demo and the CIO gets it immediately.

## FinOps Model

### Managed Agents (Through LLM Gateway)

Cost tracking is automatic and tamper-proof. Agents use the Trellis LLM Gateway as their LLM provider (`base_url = trellis-llm.hf.internal/v1`). Every inference call flows through the gateway, which logs:
- Model used (what the agent requested vs. what was actually served)
- Input/output tokens
- Cost at current pricing
- Agent ID (from Trellis-issued API key) and trace ID
- Latency

No self-reporting. No trust required. The infrastructure measures it, same as how AWS measures your compute — not your app.

The gateway also handles **smart model routing**:

```
Incoming request → Complexity classifier → Model selection
                                            ├── Simple (FAQ, lookup) → GPT-4o-mini ($0.15/1M input)
                                            ├── Medium (analysis)    → GPT-4o ($2.50/1M input)
                                            └── Complex (reasoning)  → o1 ($15/1M input)
```

Complexity classification is itself a cheap LLM call (or rule-based heuristic). The savings from routing 80% of traffic to mini models dwarfs the classification cost.

### External Agents (Self-Reported)

Vendor agents and agents using non-standard inference (local models, custom APIs) self-report costs via the `/cost-report` endpoint in the agent contract. The platform trusts-but-verifies — anomaly detection flags cost reports that deviate significantly from historical patterns.

### Trace-Level Aggregation

One event can trigger a chain: user asks SAM about benefits → SAM delegates to benefits-lookup agent → that agent calls PeopleSoft tool → returns to SAM → SAM responds. The `trace_id` links every cost event in this chain. The dashboard shows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T["Trace: abc-123"] --> S1["SAM (inference) — $0.003"]
    S1 --> BL["SAM → benefits-lookup — $0.002"]
    BL --> BT["benefits-lookup (tool) — $0.001"]
    BT --> S2["SAM (inference) — $0.002"]
    S2 --> TOTAL["Total: $0.008"]
```

Department gets billed $0.008 for that interaction. No surprises.

---

## Security & Compliance

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Azure AD** for all human and service identity. Every adapter, every agent, every dashboard user authenticates via Azure AD.
- **Managed identities** for service-to-service calls within Azure. No shared secrets.

### Agent Digital Identity

Every agent gets its own identity — not shared, not inherited from the platform. This is the foundation of governance:

- **Trellis API key** — authenticates to the LLM Gateway. Identifies which agent is making inference calls. Scoped to that agent's model policy and budget.
- **Azure AD Managed Identity** — authenticates to backend systems (PeopleSoft, Epic, UKG, ServiceNow). Each agent has its own identity with its own permissions in SailPoint/Azure AD.
- **Tool permissions** — scoped by identity. SAM's identity has access to PeopleSoft HCM. The IT help desk agent's identity has access to Ivanti. Neither can access the other's systems.
- **Budget cap** — monthly/daily cost limit enforced at the gateway. Hit the cap, agent gets throttled.

Agents execute their own tools using their own credentials. Trellis doesn't intercept tool execution — it sees tool calls in the LLM conversation stream (through the gateway) and audits them. But the actual access control is enforced by the existing IAM infrastructure (Azure AD + SailPoint). Security isn't a Trellis feature — it's an identity feature. Trellis ensures every agent *has* an identity.

- **RBAC model (human users):**
  - `platform-admin` — full access to all platform components
  - `department-admin` — manage agents/rules/tools for their department
  - `agent-operator` — view dashboards, trigger manual actions
  - `auditor` — read-only access to audit logs

### PHI Handling

- Tools marked `phi: true` require CISO review before activation
- Audit logs redact PHI from LLM prompts (log the hash, not the content)
- Agents accessing PHI run in isolated container groups with no internet egress except whitelisted endpoints
- All data at rest encrypted (Azure default). All data in transit over TLS.
- BAA in place with Azure and any LLM provider handling PHI

### Container Isolation

Each agent runs in its own Azure Container App with:
- Dedicated managed identity (least-privilege)
- Network isolation via VNet integration
- No shared storage between agents
- Resource limits (CPU/memory) enforced by platform

### HIPAA Alignment

- Audit logs retained 6+ years
- Access controls enforced at every layer
- Breach notification capability via audit trail queries
- Risk assessment documented per agent registration

---

## Operating Model

### Ownership

The platform team (IT ops / enterprise architecture) owns:
- Event router, rules engine, audit, FinOps engine
- Agent registry, tool registry, LLM gateway
- ALL adapters — adapters are infrastructure, not application code
- Dashboard and operational tooling

Think Azure landing zones. Central team owns the runway. Departments land their planes on it.

Departments own their agents. HR owns SAM. Revenue Cycle owns their coding assistant. IT owns the help desk agent. But every agent registers through the platform. Registration means:
- Listed in registry with owner, department, maturity level
- Tools and permissions reviewed
- Cost tracking active from day one
- Audit logging — non-negotiable

The platform team doesn't need to understand what every agent does. They need to know it's authorized, auditable, and not burning money.

### Support Model — "I Want an Agent"

1. **Intake** — Department fills out a one-page form: problem statement, data sources needed, tools required, expected volume.
2. **Feasibility** — Platform team assesses: adapters exist? Tools exist? PHI? New integrations? One-hour conversation, not a six-week project.
3. **Build** — Department builds (if they have developers) or requests platform team help. Agent must conform to the contract (four endpoints).
4. **Registration & Review** — Platform team reviews tool permissions. CISO reviews if PHI involved. This is the gate.
5. **Shadow → Assisted → Autonomous** — Standard maturity progression. Platform monitors cost and error rates. Department monitors output quality.

### Growth Path

- **Phase 1 (Now):** IT ops runs everything. SAM, IT help desk, 2-3 others. Prove the architecture works.
- **Phase 2:** Department self-service. Agent templates, SDK, permission review gate. Departments deploy their own agents within guardrails.
- **Phase 3:** Multi-facility. Facility-scoped agents, facility-level cost tracking, facility-specific routing rules.
- **Phase 4:** The architecture is healthcare-agnostic. Adapter pattern, agent contract, governance model — none of it is HF-specific. Worth keeping in mind.

| **Real-time** | WebSocket or SSE for live agent activity |
| **Auth** | Azure AD via MSAL |
| **Aesthetic** | Dark ops dashboard — think Datadog meets SpaceCoast CMD. Real-time event flows, glowing health indicators, trace visualizations, cost meters. |

### Why the Split

The platform is agent-agnostic — agents are HTTP endpoints that speak envelope. **The platform shares zero code with agents.** The "one language" argument only applied when we thought the platform and agents were coupled. They're not.

Python wins for the platform core because:
1. **Azure-native** — Azure SDKs, Functions, and Container Apps are Python-first.
2. **ML/AI ecosystem** — smart model routing, complexity classification, cost anomaly detection, semantic routing via embeddings — all Python territory.
3. **Hiring** — if this grows, Python backend engineers are everywhere. TypeScript backend is a smaller pool.
4. **FastAPI is purpose-built for this** — typed, async, auto-docs, Pydantic validation. The envelope schema becomes a Pydantic model and you get validation for free.

TypeScript wins for the dashboard because:
1. Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind is the best UI stack available. Period.
2. The richest charting, table, and real-time libraries are JavaScript-native.
3. This is where the "wow factor" lives — the dashboard is what leadership sees.

## Development Roadmap

Each phase delivers end-to-end functionality with a working demo.

### Phase 1: Platform Core ✅
Event router, agent registry, HTTP adapter, SQLite database, envelope handling.

### Phase 2: LLM Gateway ✅
OpenAI-compatible proxy, multi-provider support (NVIDIA NIM, Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama), token counting, cost logging, budget caps per agent.

### Phase 3: Agent Onboarding ✅
Four agent types (http, function, llm, native), auto-key provisioning, health checks, manifest sync.

### Phase 4: Rules Engine + Audit ✅
JSON condition matching, fan-out routing, rule testing/toggle, immutable audit trail with trace chains.

### Phase 5: FinOps ✅
Cost rollups by agent/department/trace, budget enforcement, smart model routing, anomaly detection.

### Phase 6: Dashboard ✅
Next.js command center — live event flow, agent health, cost metrics, rule CRUD, activity timeline. Deployed to Azure Container Apps.

### Phase 7: Healthcare Adapters ✅
HL7v2 (ADT/ORM/ORU/SIU), FHIR R4 (Patient/Encounter/Observation), Teams adapter (Bot Framework).

### Phase 8: Real Agents (In Progress)
**Security Triage Agent** — first tool-calling native agent. Cross-references vulnerabilities against HF tech stack, calculates risk scores, drafts structured advisories. Proves Tier 2 agent capability.

Incremental build plan:
- **Piece 1:** Agent LLM calls through gateway ✅ (cab3a57)
- **Piece 2:** Tool call audit logging ✅ (cab3a57)
- **Piece 3:** Email output hook
- **Piece 4:** Envelope cannon (NVD load generator)
- **Piece 5:** Upgrade seed agents to native

### Phase 9: Security & HIPAA Hardening
Address security gaps and technical debt surfaced by code review before broader deployment.

1. PHI shield default `"off"` → `"audit_only"` (one-line fix, safe default)
2. CORS lockdown — env-var configurable allowed origins
3. Management plane auth — admin API key required on all `api.py` routers
4. EnvelopeLog PHI redaction — strip/redact PHI before writing `envelope_data`
5. Fix test environment — spaCy model fixture, mark Ollama tests as integration
6. Delete or integrate dead `scorer.py` (843 LOC, unreachable)
7. Route `dispatch_llm` through budget enforcement
8. Shared `httpx` client — connection pooling, proper lifecycle
9. Model pricing single source of truth — one dict, no scattered literals

### Phase 10: Classification Engine + Platform Housekeeping (Next)
Platform-level enrichment middleware. Every inbound envelope gets auto-classified (department, category, urgency, entities) before hitting the rules engine. Senders don't need to know Trellis's routing structure — they just send raw events. This phase also introduces **Platform Housekeeping Agents** — autonomous agents that maintain Trellis itself (rule optimization, health auditing, cost analysis, schema drift detection, audit compaction). These share the "core platform infrastructure" framing with the classification engine. See [Platform Housekeeping Agents](#platform-housekeeping-agents).

### Phase 11: Agent Identity & Access
Agent digital identities with scoped permissions, credential vault (managed secrets, auto-rotation), role-based access policies, delegation chains. Required for agents that interact with downstream systems (Epic, PeopleSoft, Ivanti).

### Phase 12: Framework Adapters
Dispatch adapters for external agent runtimes — Pi SDK (RPC), Qwen-Agent, OpenClaw sessions, LangChain (HTTP). Trellis is framework-agnostic; each adapter is a thin translation layer between envelopes and the agent's native interface.

### Phase 13: Production Hardening
PostgreSQL (replace ephemeral SQLite), Azure AD integration, RBAC, persistent storage, CI/CD pipeline, load testing.

---

## Production Environment

For production deployments (specifically within the Health First Azure tenant), Trellis shifts from a lightweight local stack to a high-availability enterprise architecture. This environment is designed to meet security, scalability, and persistence requirements.

### Infrastructure Topology

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Azure Resource Group"
        ACA[Azure Container Apps<br/>Trellis Platform + Agents]
        SQL[Azure SQL Database<br/>Persistent Registry + Audit]

        AI[Application Insights]
    end

```

### Components

- **Database (Azure SQL):** Replaces ephemeral SQLite. Stores the Agent Registry, Tool Registry, Rules, and Audit Logs. Configured with a 'Basic' tier for cost efficiency during early production, scaling to Elastic Pools as agent volume grows.
- **Secrets (Azure Key Vault):** Centralized storage for sensitive API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and database connection strings. Managed Identities are used for zero-secret authentication between Container Apps and Key Vault.
- **Storage (Azure Blob/Files):** Provides persistent storage for agents that need to maintain state across restarts or handle large file attachments (e.g., Clinical SFTP drops).
- **Compute (Azure Container Apps):** Serverless container hosting that scales agents to zero when idle, minimizing costs while maintaining sub-second cold starts for production traffic.

### Deployment Quality & Governance

As per **AGENTS.md (Information Quality section)**, all production configuration must be verified before assertion. The infrastructure is defined as code (Bicep) and validated using the Azure CLI (`az bicep build`) prior to deployment.

For environment-specific context regarding Health First's Azure configuration and naming conventions, refer to **USER.md**.

## Microsoft Teams Integration Best Practices

Trellis integrates with Microsoft Teams via the **Bot Framework Adapter** (specifically the `botbuilder-core` Python SDK).

1. **Authentication:** The Teams Adapter in Layer 1 validates the `Authorization` header on incoming webhooks from the Bot Framework Service. In production, `app_id` and `app_password` are managed via **Azure Key Vault**.
2. **Schema Handling:** All Teams activities are deserialized into standard `Activity` objects before being mapped into the **Generic Envelope Spec**.
3. **Turn Context:** The adapter maintains a `TurnContext` for each interaction, ensuring that agent responses are correctly routed back to the specific conversation/tenant.
4. **FastAPI Integration:** The production adapter is implemented as a FastAPI endpoint (`/api/messages`), allowing it to coexist with the Trellis Platform Core on the same compute resource.

- **SAM agent** — working HR operations agent built on Pi SDK. Handles PTO policy questions, employee lookups, onboarding checklists via mock tools. Runs locally against Ollama (llama3.1:8b).
- **Mock HR tools** — PeopleSoft lookup, UKG schedule query, benefits lookup. Currently hardcoded responses, designed to be swapped for real integrations.
- **Pi SDK foundation** — conversation management, tool orchestration, context handling. Solid framework for a single agent.

### How It Evolves

SAM doesn't get thrown away. It becomes the first tenant on the platform:

1. **Wrap SAM** with the agent contract — add `/envelope`, `/health`, `/cost-report`, `/manifest` endpoints around the existing Pi SDK logic.
2. **Register SAM** in the platform's agent registry. Assign it the `peoplesoft-lookup`, `ukg-schedule`, and `email-send` tools.
3. **Route to SAM** via rules: `source_type=teams AND department=HR → sam-hr`.
4. **Move inference** through the LLM gateway. SAM's Pi SDK calls go through the gateway instead of directly to Ollama/Azure OpenAI. Instant FinOps visibility.
5. **Promote SAM** through maturity levels: shadow → assisted → autonomous as confidence grows.

The existing codebase becomes a reference implementation — proof that the agent contract works, that the adapter pattern is clean, that the platform adds governance without adding friction. Every subsequent agent follows SAM's path.

## Pluggable Agent Runtimes

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Directive:** "Pi should be the default agent and one could be provisioned through Trellis. Keep agnostic option for other things. Make it simple to replace when the next Pi comes along."

### Design Principle

Trellis is the **control plane**. It doesn't run agent logic — it delegates to **runtimes**. A runtime is anything that can start an agent, send it work, check its health, and stop it. Four methods. That's the whole interface.

Pi is the default runtime today. Tomorrow it could be something else. The swap should take an afternoon, not a sprint.

### Runtime Interface

```python
class AgentRuntime(ABC):
    runtime_type: str                                           # "pi", "http", "function", etc.
    async def start(config: AgentConfig) -> AgentInstance       # Provision agent
    async def stop(instance_id: str) -> None                    # Tear down
    async def send(instance_id: str, payload: dict) -> Response # Send work
    async def health(instance_id: str) -> HealthStatus          # Health check
```

**AgentConfig** carries everything needed to spin up an agent: system prompt, model, tools, temperature, max_tokens, plus an `extras` dict for runtime-specific options (sandbox config, budget caps, Pi SDK options, etc.).

### Shipped Runtimes

| Runtime | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **PiRuntime** | `pi` | Default. Uses Pi SDK's Agent class. Phase 1: LLM gateway dispatch. Phase 2: full Pi agent loop with tools + streaming. |
| **HttpRuntime** | `http` | Backward compat. POSTs envelopes to external HTTP endpoints. For vendor agents, legacy agents, anything with a URL. |

### How It Works

```
Agent Registration (with runtime_type="pi")
    ↓
Event Router matches envelope to agent
    ↓
Dispatcher looks up agent's runtime_type
    ↓
RuntimeRegistry.get("pi") → PiRuntime
    ↓
PiRuntime.start(config) → instance
PiRuntime.send(instance_id, envelope) → response
PiRuntime.stop(instance_id)
    ↓
Response back through event router → audit
```

### Agent Registration

When registering an agent, `runtime_type` defaults to `"pi"`:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "sam-hr",
  "name": "SAM - HR Operations",
  "runtime_type": "pi",
  "llm_config": {
    "system_prompt": "You are SAM, an HR operations assistant...",
    "model": "qwen3:8b"
  }
}
```

For legacy HTTP agents:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "vendor-x",
  "runtime_type": "http",
  "endpoint": "https://vendor-x.example.com/envelope",
  "health_endpoint": "https://vendor-x.example.com/health"
}
```

### Writing a New Runtime

1. Create `trellis/runtimes/your_runtime.py`
2. Implement the 4 methods of `AgentRuntime`
3. Register it: `register_runtime(YourRuntime())`
4. Agents can now use `runtime_type="your_runtime"`

Example — a hypothetical LangChain runtime:

```python
class LangChainRuntime(AgentRuntime):
    runtime_type = "langchain"

    async def start(self, config):
        chain = build_chain(config.system_prompt, config.tools)
        # ... store instance
        return AgentInstance(...)

    async def send(self, instance_id, payload):
        result = await self._chains[instance_id].ainvoke(payload)
        return RuntimeResponse(status="success", data=result)

    # ... stop, health
```

### File Layout

```
trellis/runtimes/
├── __init__.py          # Public API
├── interface.py         # AgentRuntime ABC + dataclasses
├── registry.py          # RuntimeRegistry singleton
├── pi_runtime.py        # Default: Pi SDK agents
└── http_runtime.py      # Backward compat: HTTP agents
```

### Migration Path

Existing agents (`agent_type=http|function|llm`) continue to work via legacy dispatch. The `runtime_type` field defaults to `"pi"` for new agents. Existing agents can be migrated by setting their `runtime_type` — no breaking changes.

## Document Ingestion Adapter

**Date:** 2026-03-05
**Status:** Complete. 28 tests passing.

### Why It Matters

Hospitals run on documents — policies, procedures, clinical guidelines, compliance manuals, formularies. These live as PDFs on SharePoint, shared drives, email attachments. Agents need to process them as events: a new infection control policy drops → the compliance agent indexes it, the clinical agent can answer questions about it, the training agent flags staff who need re-certification.

### Architecture

The document adapter follows the standard adapter pattern: receive input → extract text → build envelopes → route through event system. The twist: documents are chunked into segments so agents can process them incrementally without hitting token limits.

```
Upload (PDF/DOCX/TXT/CSV/MD)
    ↓
Format Detection (extension or MIME type)
    ↓
Text Extraction (PyPDF2 for PDF, python-docx for DOCX, stdlib for rest)
    ↓
Chunking (configurable size + overlap)
    ↓
One Envelope per chunk → Event Router → Rules Engine → Agent(s)
```

### Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `trellis/adapters/document_adapter.py` | Adapter: `build_document_envelopes()`, `build_batch_envelopes()` |
| `trellis/adapters/document_utils.py` | Utilities: text extraction, chunking, format detection |
| `tests/test_document_adapter.py` | 28 tests covering extraction, chunking, envelopes, batch |

### Envelope Shape

Each chunk becomes an envelope with `source_type="document"`:

```json
{
  "source_type": "document",
  "source_id": "document-pdf",
  "payload": {
    "text": "chunk content...",
    "data": {
      "filename": "infection-control-policy.pdf",
      "format": "pdf",
      "page": 3,
      "chunk_index": 7,
      "total_chunks": 24,
      "content_type": "application/pdf",
      "document_type": "policy",
      "department": "Infection Control",
      "effective_date": "2026-03-01",
      "author": "Dr. Smith",
      "version": "2.1"
    }
  },
  "routing_hints": {
    "tags": ["document", "pdf", "policy", "infection control"],
    "category": "document-ingestion",
    "department": "Infection Control"
  }
}
```

### Healthcare Metadata

Optional metadata fields for healthcare document classification:

| Field | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `document_type` | Classification | policy, procedure, guideline, protocol, compliance, form |
| `department` | Originating department | Infection Control, Pharmacy, Nursing, Compliance |
| `effective_date` | When document takes effect | ISO-8601 date |
| `author` | Document author | Dr. Smith, Compliance Committee |
| `version` | Document version | 2.1, Rev C |

### Chunking Configuration

- **Default chunk size:** 1000 characters
- **Default overlap:** 200 characters (ensures no context is lost at boundaries)
- Both configurable per upload

### Supported Formats

| Format | Library | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| PDF | PyPDF2 | Graceful error if not installed |
| DOCX | python-docx | Graceful error if not installed |
| TXT | stdlib | Always available |
| CSV | stdlib | Converted to readable text |
| Markdown | stdlib | Passed through as-is |

### Routing Rules Example

```json
{
  "name": "New policies to compliance agent",
  "conditions": {
    "source_type": "document",
    "payload.data.document_type": "policy"
  },
  "actions": {
    "route_to": "compliance-agent"
  }
}
```

## Platform Housekeeping Agents

Trellis manages user-facing agents. But who manages Trellis? These five agents do. They're registered in the same agent registry (`agent_type: "native"`, `department: "platform"`), use the same envelope/audit infrastructure, and follow the same autoresearch pattern: observe → hypothesize → test → measure → keep/discard.

**Key constraints:**
- All costs classified as **"Platform Overhead"** in FinOps — separate budget category, never billed to departments.
- Cannot be disabled via user routing rules. They're core infrastructure, like health checks on a load balancer.
- Start conservative. Most launch as "observe-only" or "suggest." Graduate to "auto-act" after the platform team trusts the recommendations.

---

### 1. Rule Optimizer

**Purpose:** Find dead rules, overlapping rules, and unmatched events. Suggest consolidations.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Schedule** | Nightly (2:00 AM) |
| **Inputs** | Routing history (audit log), rules engine config, dead-letter queue |
| **Outputs** | Report: dead rules (zero matches in 30 days), overlapping rules (same envelope matches multiple), top unmatched event patterns. Suggested new rules for frequent dead-letter patterns. |
| **Autonomy** | **suggest** — proposes rule changes for human approval via dashboard. Never auto-modifies routing. |
| **Implementation** | Reads `audit_events` table (routing decisions) + `rules` table. Aggregates match counts per rule over a sliding window. Compares rule conditions pairwise for overlap detection. Clusters dead-letter envelopes by `source_type` + `routing_hints` to suggest new rules. Single SQL-heavy cron job — no LLM needed. |

---

### 2. Health Auditor

**Purpose:** Catch agent degradation before humans notice.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Schedule** | Every 15 minutes |
| **Inputs** | Agent registry (health endpoints), historical response time data (last 7 days) |
| **Outputs** | Alerts: agent responding >10x slower than its 7-day p50, agent returning non-200, agent unreachable. Dashboard status updates. |
| **Autonomy** | **observe-only** — updates dashboard health indicators and fires alerts. Does not restart or disable agents. |
| **Implementation** | Hits each agent's `/health` endpoint. Stores response time + status in a `health_checks` table. Compares current response time against rolling p50/p95. Alert thresholds configurable per agent. Uses the existing health check infrastructure (already polling every 60s) but adds trend analysis and anomaly detection on top. |

---

### 3. Cost Optimizer

**Purpose:** Find agents burning expensive models on simple tasks. Track cost-per-resolution trends.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Schedule** | Daily (6:00 AM) |
| **Inputs** | FinOps cost events, LLM gateway logs (model requested vs. model served, prompt complexity), agent resolution outcomes |
| **Outputs** | Report: agents where >50% of calls use expensive models but prompt complexity is "simple." Cost-per-resolution trend per agent (rising = investigate). Specific model downgrade recommendations. |
| **Autonomy** | **suggest** — recommends model policy changes. Platform admin approves via dashboard. |
| **Implementation** | Queries `cost_events` joined with gateway logs. Groups by agent + model. If the complexity classifier (from smart model routing) tagged most requests as "simple" but the agent is pinned to an expensive model, flags it. Tracks `total_cost / completed_envelopes` per agent per week for trend analysis. Could use a cheap LLM call to summarize findings into a readable report, but the core logic is SQL aggregation. |

---

### 4. Schema Drift Detector

**Purpose:** Catch payload structure changes before they silently break routing or agent logic.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Schedule** | **Inline** (lightweight, on every envelope) + **daily deep scan** (1:00 AM) |
| **Inputs** | Incoming envelopes (`payload.data` structure), stored schema fingerprints per `source_type` + `source_id` |
| **Outputs** | Inline: pass/warn flag on envelope metadata (doesn't block routing). Daily: report of all detected schema changes — new fields, removed fields, type changes. Diff against last known good schema. |
| **Autonomy** | **observe-only** — flags drift, never blocks envelopes. Alert escalation if a source's schema changes significantly (>3 fields added/removed). |
| **Implementation** | **Inline path:** Extract `payload.data` keys + types → hash → compare against stored fingerprint for that `source_type`/`source_id`. If hash differs, add `schema_drift: true` to envelope metadata. Sub-millisecond — just a hash comparison. **Daily path:** For each source, build a full schema tree from the last 24h of envelopes. Diff against the stored baseline. Store new baseline if platform admin acknowledges the change. Schema fingerprints stored in a `schema_baselines` table. |

---

### 5. Audit Compactor

**Purpose:** Prevent unbounded audit log growth. Roll up old events, archive detail, keep summaries.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Schedule** | Weekly (Sunday 3:00 AM) |
| **Inputs** | Audit log (events older than configured retention window, default 90 days for detail) |
| **Outputs** | Compacted summary records (hourly rollups: event counts by type, agent, department). Archived raw events moved to cold storage (Azure Blob). Compaction report: rows compacted, storage freed, archive location. |
| **Autonomy** | **auto-act** — compacts and archives automatically. All actions logged. Reversible: raw events exist in cold storage indefinitely (HIPAA 6-year retention still met). |
| **Implementation** | Groups audit events by hour + event_type + agent_id + department. Creates summary rows with counts and key metrics. Moves raw rows to Azure Blob Storage (JSON lines, gzipped) organized by `YYYY/MM/DD/`. Deletes raw rows from primary database after confirming archive write succeeded. Uses database transactions — if archive write fails, nothing gets deleted. The only housekeeping agent that starts as auto-act because (a) it's append-only operations on a new table + blob writes, (b) the original data is preserved in cold storage, and (c) unbounded DB growth is a real operational risk that shouldn't wait for human approval every week. |

---

### Registration Pattern

All five agents register like any other native agent:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "platform-rule-optimizer",
  "name": "Rule Optimizer",
  "department": "platform",
  "agent_type": "native",
  "runtime_type": "pi",
  "tags": ["housekeeping", "platform-infra"],
  "cost_mode": "managed",
  "maturity": "autonomous"
}
```

The `department: "platform"` tag is what separates them in FinOps. The event router skips user routing rules for `department: "platform"` agents — they're triggered by schedule, not by envelope routing.

### Dashboard Integration

The dashboard gets a **Platform Health** tab showing:
- Rule Optimizer: last run, dead rules found, suggestions pending
- Health Auditor: real-time agent health grid with trend sparklines
- Cost Optimizer: top 5 cost reduction opportunities, total savings if implemented
- Schema Drift: sources with active drift warnings
- Audit Compactor: DB size trend, last compaction stats, archive size

---

*This architecture was designed during a session with Eric O'Brien on 2026-02-22. Runtime interface added 2026-02-23 per Eric's directive to make Pi the default runtime while keeping the platform runtime-agnostic. Document ingestion adapter added 2026-03-05.*

## Phase 13: Intelligent Routing — Agent-Declared Intake + Scored Matching

**Status:** Full design complete — see [`docs/INTELLIGENT-ROUTING-DESIGN.md`](docs/INTELLIGENT-ROUTING-DESIGN.md)

**Problem:** Current routing is rigid pattern matching — static rules with hardcoded conditions. Doesn't scale past 20+ agents. Adding a new agent requires manually creating routing rules. Classification Engine infers hints but feeds them into dumb rules. See §2 of the design doc for concrete Health First examples.

**Vision:** Agents declare what they handle. The Classification Engine's output feeds a multi-dimensional scoring engine that scores every envelope against every agent simultaneously. Best match wins. Rules evolve into a small policy layer — governance constraints, not routing logic. A daily feedback loop improves routing accuracy over time.

### Architecture Change

**Current flow:**
```
Envelope → Classification Engine (tag) → Rules Engine (pattern match) → Agent
```

**New flow:**
```
Envelope → Classification Engine (enrich)
         → Pre-Score Policy Filter (PHI gate, maturity gate, scope)
         → Agent Scorer (5 dimensions × historical weight × load factor)
         → Post-Score Policy Enforcement (mandatory CC, regulatory overrides)
         → Dispatcher → Agent(s)
         → Feedback Collector → Daily Weight Updater
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Scoring dimensions:** Category affinity (30%), Source type (25%), Keyword overlap/Jaccard (20%), System match (15%), Priority alignment (10%) — weighted, configurable.
- **Hierarchical categories:** Dot-notation (`security.vulnerability.cvss_critical`). Parent declarations score 0.8 for child envelopes, child declarations score 0.4 for parent envelopes.
- **Server breach problem:** If top 2 agents both score ≥0.55 and differ by ≤0.15, and their categories appear in the co-dispatch map (e.g., security+incident), both receive envelope as co-primaries.
- **Historical multiplier:** Per-agent, per-category success rate → multiplier [0.70, 1.30]. α=0.15 EMA, updated daily. Cold start = 1.0 (neutral).
- **Load factor:** In-memory in-flight count. Penalizes at >50% capacity, eliminates at 100%.
- **Policies:** VETO, REQUIRE, REDIRECT, CC types. PHI Isolation, Shadow Gate, Anti-Circular, Compliance CC, After-Hours Redirect are the core healthcare policies.
- **Migration:** shadow → hybrid → scored modes via single API call. Rollback is immediate.

### Implementation Stories (11 total, ~8-10 days)

| Story | What | Days |
|-------|------|------|
| 13.1 | Agent intake schema + storage | 0.5 |
| 13.2 | Overlap validation | 0.5 |
| 13.3 | Scoring engine (core) | 1.5 |
| 13.4 | Policy layer | 1.0 |
| 13.5 | Routing decision + score logging | 0.5 |
| 13.6 | Feedback collection | 0.5 |
| 13.7 | Daily weight updater | 0.5 |
| 13.8 | Agent load tracking | 0.5 |
| 13.9 | Routing mode API + shadow report | 0.5 |
| 13.10 | Intake declarations for existing agents | 0.5 |
| 13.11 | Dashboard: Routing Intelligence tab | 1.0 |

Full acceptance criteria, test requirements, and file specifications in the design doc.

### Success Criteria
- New agent registration requires NO manual rule creation — declare intake, done
- ≥92% routing accuracy (measured against human-verified test set)
- Policy layer ≤10 active policies (vs. potentially hundreds of routing rules)
- Self-learning improves routing accuracy measurably over first month
- Cold start solved — new agents route correctly from day one with good intake declaration
- Shadow mode agreement rate ≥90% before switching to scored routing
